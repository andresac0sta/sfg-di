Spring frame has a default profile and is considered active if no active
profile has been set.

We can annotate beans for the default profile if there there is no active
profile set.

By having a default profile we don't have to always specify an active profile.

Let's set the spanish profile as our default profile in I18NSpanishService.java
if there are no other profiles.

    @Profile({"ES", "default"})

Now comment out in the resources/applications.properties file
    #spring.profiles.active=EN
if you run the application the default profile will be use
if you set the spring.profiles.active=EN   to EN the English
profile will be used.
