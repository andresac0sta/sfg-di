In this module we are implementing dependency injection
Spring will instantiate the objects and inject them.
Create an interface and implementation of GreetingService

Annotate the GreetingServiceImpl.java with
    @Service
this will tell spring this is a service added to the context.

There are 3 ways of doing dependency injection with spring

--Constructor injection ( THE BEST WAY).
--Setter injection(2nd best way).
--Property injection (NOT RECOMMENDED).

In  each case you will need to use the  @Autowired annotation
at the constructor, setter, or property.
