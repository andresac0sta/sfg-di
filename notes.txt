Before we were using the spring way of using configuration properties now we are going to
use the spring boot way.
Think of spring boot as a wrapper around spring.

In spring boot the framework reads the application.properties automatically.

for different profiles the naming convention is to do application-profile.properties

    application-dev.properties
    application-qa.properties

There can only be one application-profile at any given time in the application.properties file

    spring.profiles.active=dog,EN,qa
